# LibADLmidi-Banks
Banks used for adlmidi that I modified for use on a Real OPL3 enabled card.

What this is
A Simple home for every bank I modified for one OPL3 chip with the opl3 bank editor by Wohlstand.

Why
it is fun and there are no multiple opl3 cards that i know of and most modern devices I have seen use a single chip
