# LibADLmidi-Banks
Banks used for adlmidi that I modified for use on a Real OPL3 enabled card.

# What this is

A Simple home for every bank I modified for one OPL3 chip with the opl3 bank editor by Wohlstand. Each bank is heavily modified from DMXOPL from sneakernets so a few instruments will probably sound a little more hollow or weak. The results though seem to work out while listening.

# Why

it is fun and there are no multiple opl3 cards that i know of and most modern devices I have seen use a single chip.

OPL2 is also supported to an extent.
