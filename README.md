# LibADLmidi-Banks
Banks used for adlmidi that I modified for use on a Real OPL3 enabled card.

# What this is

A Simple home for every bank I modified for one OPL3 chip with the opl3 bank editor by Wohlstand. Each bank is heavily modified from DMXOPL from sneakernets so a few instruments will probably sound a little more hollow or weak. The results though seem to work out while listening. Housed here are Shareware versions of a few games that demostrate what the opl3 can do.
For proper sound output in the shareware titles when using a soundblaster 16 or compatible you must set the dmxoption with the following on the commandline otherwise note cuts will happen.

set dmxoption=-opl3

for doom and heretic you need to add -file genmidi.op2


This works in dosbox under emulation as well.

# Why

it is fun and there are no multiple opl3 cards that i know of and most modern devices I have seen use a single chip.

OPL2 is also supported to an extent.
